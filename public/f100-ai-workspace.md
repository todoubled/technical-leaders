## Using Your AI Workspace

### The Power of Two Modes

Think of your workspace like having two different meeting rooms:

**üß† The Strategy Room (NotebookLM)**
- When to use: Planning, brainstorming, analyzing trends
- Example: "I need to understand market opportunities"
- What happens: Deep exploration of ideas and possibilities

**‚ö° The War Room (Claude with MCPs)**
- When to use: Executing, automating, reporting
- Example: "Create a weekly status report from all our tools"
- What happens: Actual work gets done across your systems

### Daily Workflow Example

**Morning (NotebookLM)**:
1. Upload yesterday's meeting notes
2. Ask: "What are the key action items and strategic implications?"
3. Get insights you might have missed

**Midday (Claude)**:
1. "Create Linear tasks for all action items from this morning's meeting"
2. "Update the project tracker in Airtable"
3. "Email a summary to the team at team@company.com"

**Afternoon (Claude)**:
1. "Pull this week's analytics from PostHog"
2. "Generate a performance report and email it to stakeholders@company.com"
3. "What trends should I be paying attention to?"

### Power Commands to Try

**In NotebookLM**:
- "What patterns do you see across all our strategic documents?"
- "Generate 10 innovative ideas based on our market research"
- "What are the potential risks we haven't considered?"

**In Claude with MCPs**:
- "Create a dashboard of all projects due this month from Linear"
- "Analyze user engagement trends in PostHog for the last quarter"
- "Draft a weekly status update and email it to leadership@company.com"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Claude can't connect to my tool"

**Solution**:
1. Check your API key is correct (no extra spaces)
2. Ensure you have admin permissions in the tool
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting: `/disconnect [toolname]` then `/connect [toolname]`

#### "NotebookLM isn't understanding my documents"

**Solution**:
1. Ensure documents are in supported formats (PDF, .docx, .txt)
2. Check file size (max 50MB per document)
3. Try re-uploading if processing seems stuck

#### "Commands aren't working in Claude"

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're using Claude Pro (not the free version)
2. Check you've completed the MCP setup for that tool
3. Try refreshing Claude (Cmd+R on Mac, Ctrl+R on Windows)

#### "I'm getting rate limit errors"

**Solution**:
1. This means you're hitting usage limits
2. Wait 1-2 minutes and try again
3. Consider upgrading your plan if this happens frequently
