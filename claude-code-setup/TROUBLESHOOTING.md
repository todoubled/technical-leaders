## Installation Issues

### ‚ùå "Command not found" after installation

**Symptoms:**
- After installation, typing `claude` shows "command not found"
- The installation seemed successful but Claude Code doesn't work

**Solutions:**

#### Solution 1: Refresh your terminal
1. **Close** your current Terminal/PowerShell window completely

#### Solution 2: Check if Node.js is installed
**Mac:**
```bash
node --version
```

**Windows:**
```powershell

**Mac:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc`
3. Type: `source ~/.zshrc`
4. Try `claude --version` again

2. Type: `npm config get prefix`
3. Copy the path shown

   - Find "Path" in System variables
   - Click "Edit"
   - Click "New"
   - Paste the path

   - Go to API Keys
   - Create a new key
   - Copy it immediately (you can't see it again!)
