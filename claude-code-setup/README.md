# Claude Code Setup Guide for Executives

> üéØ **Welcome!** This guide will help you install Claude Code on your computer in about 10-15 minutes. No technical experience required!

## What is Claude Code?

Think of Claude Code as your AI assistant that lives on your computer. Just like having a skilled developer sitting next to you, Claude Code can:
- Write and edit code for you
- Analyze your files and projects
- Help automate repetitive tasks
- Answer technical questions
- Create documentation and reports

## Before We Start (Prerequisites)

You'll need:
1. **A computer** running Windows 10/11 or macOS 10.15 or newer
2. **Internet connection** for downloading software
3. **Administrator access** to your computer (ability to install software)
4. **About 500MB of free disk space**

## üçé macOS Installation (Mac Users)

### Option A: Automated Installation (Recommended)
We've created a script that does everything for you!

#### Step 1: Open Terminal
Terminal is like a text-based control panel for your Mac.

1. Press `Command + Space` on your keyboard
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press `Enter`
4. A black or white window with text will appear - this is Terminal!

> üí° **Don't worry!** The Terminal might look intimidating, but you're just going to copy and paste one command.

#### Step 2: Download and Run the Setup Script
Copy this entire command (triple-click to select all):

```bash
curl -o setup-mac.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/claude-setup/main/setup-mac.sh && chmod +x setup-mac.sh && ./setup-mac.sh
```

**For now, use this local version:**
1. In Terminal, type exactly:
```bash
cd ~/code/technical-leaders/claude-code-setup
```
2. Press Enter
3. Then type:
```bash
./setup-mac.sh
```
4. Press Enter

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Check your system
- ‚úÖ Install necessary tools
- ‚úÖ Set up Claude Code
- ‚úÖ Verify everything works

You'll see progress messages as it works. This takes about 5-10 minutes.

### Option B: Manual Installation
If the automated script doesn't work, here's how to do it step-by-step:

2. Copy and paste this command:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
3. Press Enter and follow the prompts (you may need to enter your password)

#### Step 2: Install Node.js
Node.js lets JavaScript programs run on your computer.

1. In Terminal, type:
```bash
brew install node
```
2. Press Enter and wait for completion

## ü™ü Windows Installation (Windows Users)

### Option A: Automated Installation (Recommended)
We've created a script that does everything for you!

#### Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
PowerShell is Windows' command center.

1. Click the Windows Start button (or press Windows key)
2. Type "PowerShell"
3. **Right-click** on "Windows PowerShell"
4. Click "Run as Administrator"
5. Click "Yes" when asked for permission
6. A blue window with white text will appear

> üí° **Important:** You must run as Administrator or the installation won't work!

#### Step 2: Allow Script Execution (One-Time Setup)
Windows blocks scripts by default for security. Let's temporarily allow our setup script:

Copy and paste this command:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```
Press Enter.

#### Step 3: Download and Run the Setup Script
Copy and paste this command:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/claude-setup/main/setup-windows.ps1" -OutFile "setup-windows.ps1"; .\setup-windows.ps1
```

**For now, use this local version:**
1. In PowerShell, type exactly:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Downloads
```
2. Press Enter
3. Copy the setup-windows.ps1 file to your Downloads folder
4. Then type:
```powershell
.\setup-windows.ps1
```
5. Press Enter

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Check your system
- ‚úÖ Install necessary tools
- ‚úÖ Set up Claude Code
- ‚úÖ Verify everything works

You'll see progress messages. This takes about 5-10 minutes.

### Option B: Manual Installation
